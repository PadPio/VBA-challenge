This project includes VBA scripts developed with the assistance of an AI-based educational tool designed to teach coding and scripting. The AI provided examples and guidance on VBA syntax and logic, which were then adapted and written into the final scripts by myself. the process of which took several plus hours Miss. Moran (my class teacher) was made aware of my using an AI-study-tool, in order to better learn. The use of the AI tool was strictly for educational purposes, to better understand the scripting process, and to tailor the code to the specific needs of this project. The final code represents my understanding and application of the concepts learned during this process. Beyond the AI, I labored an additional dozen (plus) hours, over the last two days reviewing previous class videos and notes, all the while working, assembling and puzzling together this project.
